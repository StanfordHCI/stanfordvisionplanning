	<li><b>What is #stanfordlorax?</b>

	<li><b>Why are ideas only 140 characters?</b>
	<p>The goal is to lower the barrier to entry, all you need is an idea or an issue that you want to raise. Once you submit an idea the website automatically creates a forum thread for that idea that you can go to by clicking on the idea. That thread is a great place to discuss the idea with others. Anyone who votes on the idea is subscribed to the forum thread.</p>
	</li>

	<li><b>Who can participate?</b> 
	<p>Anyone with an @stanford.edu email can create an account. You will use your Stanford email to receive a registration code then use your registration code to sign up. This way you are an anonymous, verified Stanford student. We do not link your Stanford email address or  your registration code with your account. We only keep a hash of your email address and registration code for verification. The code for #stanfordlorax is open source and available here: <%= link_to "Github", "https://github.com/StanfordHCI/stanfordvisionplanning" %>
