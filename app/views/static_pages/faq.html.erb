	<li><b>Why are ideas only 140 characters?</b>
	<p>The goal is to lower the barrier to entry, all you need is an idea or an issue that you want to raise. Once you submit an idea the website automatically creates a forum thread for that idea that you can go to by clicking on the idea. That thread is a great place to discuss the idea with others. Anyone who votes on the idea is subscribed to the forum thread.</p>
