<h1>Receive a registration code to sign up</h1>

<p>It is important that anyone participating on #stanforlorax be a Stanford student so you need an @stanford.edu email to create an account.</p>
<p> You will use your Stanford email to receive a registration code then use your registration code to sign up. This way you are an anonymous, verified Stanford student. We do not link your Stanford email address or  your registration code with your account. We only keep a hash of your email address and registration code for verification. The code for #stanfordlorax is open source and available here: <%= link_to "Github", "https://github.com/StanfordHCI/stanfordvisionplanning" %>. <%= link_to "Learn more", faq_path %>.
